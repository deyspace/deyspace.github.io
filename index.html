          Hey there! I'm a part-time HCDE MA student at UW. I want to learn all about the technology
          and techniques used to design and created physical objects. I love the whole process of 
          experimentation and hope to get better at documenting that jounery, visually, in this class.
          I hope I can help my peers out with sketching and prototyping!
