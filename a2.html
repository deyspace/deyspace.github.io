        <br>+ thanks to classmates: Tyler for the tutorials!!, 
        Rene for the tips troubleshooting with finding grasshopper files, and Sky for helping me out with Rhino to Illustrator
        <br>+ write up of process below :)

        Parametric model requirements:
        <br><br>
        1/ 30 parts to be laser cut that can be clipped together
        <br>
        2/ at least 1 part should enable you to connect 
        a piece to another without use of glue or fasteners
        <br>
        3/ include notes in the grasshopper definition so it's 
        clear what a user should input and bake 
        <br>
        4/ fit should be such that the parts don't come apart with a light shaking

            I used the following tutorials:<br>
            / <a href="https://vimeo.com/35707093">3D puzzles with grasshopper (from 2012!)</a><br>
            / <a href="https://youtu.be/lJ3XkC-cJzI?si=TSvD6IISTV5_R_1k"

             class="link">extrude command - rhino basics</a> 
            <br><br>I initally wanted to make something practical. Like a fruitbowl that was peanut shaped (like the wood one below).
            But the formula for the grasshopper tutorial kept slicing my baked slats in the wrong areas.
            I concluded that my shape was too award for the cutting technique I was using, so I decided to make a "simpler" shape.
            <br><br>
            I then tried to make a ramp for my daughter to roll her cars on. 
            The shape was easy to make because I had spent 10s of hours making various vases to test against the grasshopper formula, 
            but I couldn't get it to work. But again, the formula didn't work for some reason....

            <br><br>After hours of troubleshooting, I learned that the grasshopper formula:
            <br> - only worked with solid shapes
            <br> - if I wanted to make to 'shell closed polysurface', the equation only worked if the shell was >50% of the shape

        I got really good at making shapes...but needed to calm down my dream of creating something practical..
        <br><br>
        What I did: 
        <br>
        <br>1/ cylinder extrude (diameter around 100mm, based on the size of cardboard I had and how much I had)
        <br>(2/) (I wanted to fillet the edges, but didn't want to risk making the shape "too complciated" or else my grasshopper formula wouldnt work...)
        <br>3/ shell closed polysurface about 30% down (making sure its above 50% of the cylinder)
        <br>4/ run grasshopper equation (make sure the slicers or the 'cuts' = the thickness required for the cardboard)
        <br>5/ separate the sliced sets and 'smashed' each piece individually to get 2D pieces to print

        <br>- I hate Rhino x grasshopper (as a noob)
        <br>- it was an emotional journey

      The export from rhino to Illustrator was easier than I thought it would be. yay!
      <br><br>What I did:<br>
            <br> 1/ removed all the extra curves/lines that cut through the solid shape
            <br> 2/ matched the artboard to my cardboard pieces
            <br> (3/ if I had time, I would have ran some test pieces)
            <br> 4/ laser away! this was the easy part
            <br> 5/ assemble starting with the middle cross pieces<br><br>

        Learnings: 
        <br>
        <br>+ I needed more time...
        <br>- I needed to consider where the slicers (or fitted cuts) would be, especially when they 
        cut close to the edges of some of pieces. I had to just rip of some of the dangly thin strips that came out of some of my pieces
        <br>- Labeling pieces would have helped make the assembly easier.
