        3D printing requirements:
        <br><br>
        1/ calibrate your process such that you can print within .2mm tolerance
        <br>
        2/ document print settings and print time
        <br>
        3/ Your clipped together cardboard needs to pass a shake test

        I went straight to modeling before sketching and that didn't work out as well because I didn't
        really understand the scale of the object I was making and also I didn't get a chance to think
        too deeply about tolorances. <br>

        <br>FAIL! This is why the first clip I printed was too small and also had only a 1mm gap for 3.6mm cardboard.
  

       
       <div class="project-content project-img-row">

        For my second attempt, I made sure to account for the thickness of the cardboard appropriately. 
        Especially because it wasn't a 'flexible' clip but more of a slide in clip. So I needed to consider
        have a tighter grip (teeth) to prevent sliding.
        <br><br>
        What I did: 
        <br>
        <br>+ designed teeth that allowed a 2mm gap for the 3.6mm cardboard
        <br>+ create a thicker rounded external edge (rather than flat/thin) to prevent the teeth from bending outward
        <br>+ snuck in a little fun by cutting out a small flower in the clip (since I was making it for my child)
        <br>+ drew and cut some fun cardboard shapes for the clips to clip together :)
<br>
        <br>- the clip was a little snugg, but it was okay because cardboard has some give
        <br>- if I the clip was connecting a solid material, I'd need to make the claws more flexible 
        or if it's a fixed shape clip, I'd need to design a gap that is closer to the thickness of the material being clipped
        <br><br>

          Fini! This turned out pretty cute. Although my clip add some print shape errors due to
          the shape of the flower. It was a risk I took and it still printed out okay!
            <br><br>

            Not really a shake gif here but you can see that my daughter had a hard time pulling the clips out.
            So they were super secure with the cardboard pieces.
