        <br>+ thanks to classmates: Eva, Emily, and Gina for helping me get started with the laser machine 
        and sharing learnings. AND Jaimie for helping me with my Cuttle question on Discord.

        Press kit requirements:
        <br><br>
        1/ at least 30 instances of at least one unique part
        <br>
        2/ the parts must have slots that press fit into the other
        <br>
        3/ parts in the kit and be laser cut out of cardboard 
        <br>
        4/ fit should be such that the parts don't come apart with a light shaking

            I wanted to make something that my daughter could play with,

            <br><br>But it soon felt a little boring after I tried to 'build a village', 
            so I shifted gears and thought about what can I make with 30 pieces that are similar..?

       Tested out an idea quickly with thin carboard. 
       I initially made 90 degree cuts on the circles, but wanted more space for the
       30 pieces that would fit around the edge of the circle, so I angled the cut.

        I first started trying to use Rhino...but it broke my brain, 
        so I went back to Cuttle, it's UI was cuttlier than Rhino:)
        <br><br>
        I also wanted to sneak in a stop motion animation of a ball dropping
        and bouncing back up into the 30 pieces. I thought my daughter would enjoy that.
        <br><br>
        Learnings: 
        <br>
        <br>+ cardboard was about 4mm thick
        <br>+ I had pieces that were between 7x14in and 8.5x21in
        <br>+ I need to consider edges of the cardboard when cutting because they were thinner 
        from the folds of the boxes
<br>
        <br>- I initially made the circle too big in diameter and had to size down at 
        the lab when I realized my circle was bigger than my carboard piece. 
        I must have made a measurement mistake when designing. Luckily it was an easy fix.
        <br><br>- my 30 piece slots were also too wide to fit the amount of cardboard I had, 
        another mismeasurement when designing. So I had to reduce their size as well

      Here was the fun(ner) part. 

      I was nervous about using the machine, but luckily I had experienced classmates helping me.
      <br><br>What I did<br>
<br>1/create a test cut template with varying thicknesses 
<br>2/test out the laser machine settings 
<br>    - 20s, 50p, 50f (needed to run the test twice to cut through)
<br>    - 20s, 60p, 50f (increasing the power caused more burning, didn't cut through)
<br>    - 10s, 50p, 60f (SUCCESS!!!)
<br>3/tested out the best 'pressfit' of the cuts. I was debating between 3.2 and 3.4/3.6
<br>4/decided on 3.2 and adjusted all of my cuts in my design
<br>5/ready to print!<br><br>
<br>
      Learnings: 
      <br>
      <br>+ making test 'cut' thickness pieces asap, it could influence the design
      <br>+ the laser machine is very cool
    
<br>
      <br>- should have worn a mask, I felt the smoke in my nose, or maybe that's what the cardboard smelled like
      <br>
      <br><br>

      <div class="project-content project-img-row">
        <img src="/a1/a1-laser-test.png" />
        <img src="a1/a1-thickness-test.png" />
        <img src="a1/a1-test.png" /></div>

        <br><br><br><br>

        I should have chosen a cutfit that wasn't so tight...
        it made it diffult to assemble the pieces and crunched up the cardboard. 
        I was over worried about the shake test, but I'm pretty sure at 3.6, 
        the pieces wouldn't have fallen out.

          <br><br><br>
          Lucky me, when I was done printing, it was pouring rain outside...
          <br><br>
          <div class="project-content project-img-row">

          <br> Exactly how I expected it to look, BUT because I had so many pieces of cardboard
            I couldn't really see the stop motion animation I created in the 30 pieces.
            <br><br>

          If I were to do this again, I would use a thinner board and a larger circle, 
          maybe have the stop motion animation be on the outside of the spinner rather than inside.
