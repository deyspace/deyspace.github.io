        CNC milling a box requirements:
        <br><br>
        1/ box with e.g. boxjoints/fingerjoints, tabs, or another joining method 
        <br>
        2/ can be milled out of FR1 on the Othermill
        <br>
        3/ use dogbones or other milling aids
        <br>
        4/ use Bantam Tools' software to generate g-code
        <br>
        5/ mill the box and assemble it -- it should not fall apart

            I should have started out sketching, but instead
            I went straight to Rhino. This is probably why it took me an extra 
            4 hours to make something I could actually print. 
            <br><br>
            I tried for about 1 hour to go the rhino x grasshopper route, because 
            it would be easier to make design adjustments (especially with tolerances) but
            I still found it challenging to use grasshopper. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jW8fVBb-i-OkHQUZ8GTUGXONb_Oe-VWw/view?usp=drive_link" 
            class="link">This tutorial</a> seemed promising, but I shifted gears and went back to designing in
            Rhino based on the tips that Yubo shared.
            
            <br><br>
            My new fave Rhino commands: Dim, join, mirror, and curveboolean. Aspirationally and also unintentually ended up with a box piece that worked for all 6 sides. 
            So I didn't need to design different tabs for the different sides. <br><br>

      My first print was way too big. I made 5cm squares that just took too much material.
      Also I designed my slots to be smaller than my tabs =..= (again, I should have sketched/planned first).
      So I went back to rhino and made a smaller model.

      <br><br>What I did<br>
            <br> - created 2 tabs and 2 slots
            <br> - I was going to try 0.1 tolerance, but Yubo and Flo said that was too loose, so I reduced tolerace.
            <br> - in my first mill, my bit broke in half, it was because I didn't add and offselt
            <br> - tried tolerance = 0.03mm first, the tabs and slots didn't fit, not even close
            <br> - tried tolerance = 0.05mm, it was a perfect fit, I felt like 0.045mm would have worked too 
            
  <br>
      <br>After finding a good fit, I printed my first cube! With some light cellphone tapping, all the
      pieces fit in nicely. I found the edges a little sharp, so I printed another cube with fillet edges and threw 
      in some small circles to make a die. 
      <br>

          The hardest part of the assembly was removing the milled pieces off
          of the bottom plate. I chipped some of the shiny copper when removing it &#128531. The extra circle pieces are 
          the jingly bits inside the die.
