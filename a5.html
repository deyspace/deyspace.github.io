        <br> 3/ helpful commands: 'cage edit' --> 'bounding box' and 'offsetSrf' to hallow out the rock

     <br>+ 2mm thick lamp was too thick, I could probably go to 1mm or less
     <br>+ the tabs on my circular insert need to be thicker to hold the heavy lamp pieces, maybe 4mm instead of 1mm
     <br>+ 0.1mm tolerance was perfect!
     <br>+ I felt like I want a larger or longer lamp, to create a more dramatic effect...if time permits
     <br>+ maybe back to the drawing board

        oh gosh, I went down a deep deep rabbit hole of molding 'rocks' out of spheres and trying to fit them together. 
        I decided instead of printing 3 separate rock pieces, I'd print two large groups of rocks to produce a longer lamp 
        and less managing of internal attachments.
        <br><br>
        The process: 
        <br>
        <br>1/ I forgot how I hollowed out my original test rock &#128529 so after 6hrs of a lot of mesh troubleshooting, I found this tutorial <a href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=ftrc&client=firefox-b-1-d&q=how+to+hallow+out+surface+in+rhino#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:9cf83126,vid:kRM1WquHLvY,st:4" 
        class="link">hollow out a model with Rhino</a> tutorial
        <br>2/ rock max size followed the max printing surface for Prusa4: Build Volume	250 x 210 x 220 mm | 9.84 x 8.3 x 8.6 in
        <br>3/ I created 5 different rock shapes using 'cage edit'
        <br>4/ 'boolean union' the top 2 rocks and the bottom 3 rocks, so they were two separate meshes
        <br>5/ 'boolean differenced' the 2 rock meshes to create a hole in the middle for the light to fit through
        <br>6/ cut a whole at the top for the lamp to go through (like the sketch)
        <br><br>

      I basically maxed out the width and depth of the printer area. Thank goodness it all fit.
      <br><br>Learnings<br>
            <br> + I initially added a lot of supports for my first print, but later realized
            that I didn't need that many supports because my lamp was thicker, so even through
            there were hanging edges, it would still print okay without falling apart
            <br> + print at 90% speed, helps with object stability
            <br> - organic tree supports were a pain to take off, took me 1.5 hrs to remove all of it
            <br> + vertical box supports took me 5min to remove
            <br> - lamp thickness = 1.5mm (I still feel like it could of been thinner, but didn't redesign due to time restrictions)
            <br> - first rock print took 26hrs @90% speed (with the organic supports)
            <br> - second rock print took 19hrs @90% speed (with box supports)

        test print innards to help stablilize the lamp wires<br><br>

        - wire fitted slot was too small, so adjusted from 3.5mm to 4.75mm
        <br> - the radius of the innard piece were too small (I printed these test pieces while the lamps were printing)
        <br> - due to time (and brain capacity) I wasn't able to reprint better fitting innards
        <br><br>
        
        If I had more time, I would remeasure the diameter of my lamps and print matching innard pieces.
        But because my prints took about 2 days to print with 1 spool of PLA, I ran out of time to fine tune my connection pieces.

          <br> Final lamp turned out better than I expected. The print lines gave the 'rock' shapes a even
          more organic feel.
            <br><br>

           I also noticed that I had rocks (that I stole from the olympic coast) on my desk indirectly inpiring me.
           While I aimed to have a zen lamp vibe, the making of the lamp was far from zen...
